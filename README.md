# Functional Programming, Constructor University Bremen, 2025-2026

In this course, we will learn how to work with the Lean 4 language.
Please note that Lean 3 is very different.

The course consists of weekly lectures, tutorial sessions, and
homework assignments.

Homework assignments are available through GitHub Classrooms and must be handed
in by 9:30 on Fridays (15 minutes before the lecture starts).

Assignments done during the tutorial session do not need to be handed in.

Learning goals:
1. Learn to read and write code in a functional style.
2. Learn to work with Lean as a programming language.
3. Learn to reason about your code in Lean.
