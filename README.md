# Functional Programming, Constructor University Bremen, 2025-2026

In this course, we will learn how to work with the Lean 4 language.
Please note that Lean 3 is very different.

The course consists of weekly lectures, tutorial sessions, and
homework assignments.

Homework assignments are available through GitHub Classrooms and must be handed
in by 9:30 on Fridays (15 minutes before the lecture starts).

Assignments done during the tutorial session do not need to be handed in.

Learning goals:
1. Learn to read and write code in a functional style.
2. Learn to work with Lean as a programming language.
3. Learn to reason about your code in Lean.

Materials:
- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)
- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)

Overview of lectures:
1. Introduction to Lean.

**Important information about the homework:** due to a bug in GitHub Classroom,
the first invite link you will receive for the homework repository is usually broken.
Clicking the classroom link below will create your repository, but you will
need to wait for a new invite link before you have full access.  I will send
these links twice a day, please be patient.  In the meantime, you should be able
to still see your repository in the [cub-fp-2025 organisation](https://github.com/cub-fp-2025).

Please reach out to me if you have created a repository using the link below,
and haven't received a new invite link after 24 hours.
